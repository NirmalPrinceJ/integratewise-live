INTEGRATEWISE
Universal Cognitive Operating System
PROPOSED SYSTEM — COMPLETE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

AI-Powered Knowledge Workspace
First application since 1945 to complete the loop of human approval
and post-approval agent execution with audit rails and evidence backing
IntegrateWise LLP
Version 1.0  |  February 2026
Confidential

1. Executive Summary
IntegrateWise is a Universal Cognitive Operating System — an AI-powered Knowledge Workspace that fundamentally changes how organizations work with their tools, data, and AI. It is the first application since 1945 to complete the full loop of human approval and post-approval agent execution with audit rails and evidence backing.

CORE PHILOSOPHY
“AI That Thinks in Context, Waits for Approvals”
Normalize Once, Render Anywhere  |  Enhance, Don’t Replace

1.1 Three Core Problems Solved
Problem
Pain
IntegrateWise Solution
GenAI Divide
AI conversations lost in individual chat histories. Organizational knowledge dies with the session.
Brainstorming Layer captures AI conversations as organizational memory. MCP Connectors ingest AI sessions into the system.
Tool Sprawl
300+ fields across dozens of tools. No single truth. Humans become the integration layer.
Spine normalizes to 54 canonical fields (82% reduction). “Normalize Once, Render Anywhere.”
CS Team Paradox
Teams spend more time wrestling data than serving customers. Manual sync across siloed tools.
Loader + Cognitive Views eliminate humans as data middleware. Background intelligence replaces manual work.

1.2 The Core Loop
LOAD → NORMALIZE → STORE → THINK → REVIEW & APPROVE → ACT → REPEAT

The differentiator: The REVIEW & APPROVE (Govern) stage is a hard gate. Nothing executes without human approval + audit trail + evidence. This is what makes IntegrateWise fundamentally different from every AI-native tool on the market.

2. Four-Layer Architecture (L0–L3)
IntegrateWise is organized into four architectural layers, each with distinct responsibilities. Data flows from external tools through L3 (backend engine), surfaces through L1 (workspace), and is reasoned about by L2 (cognitive layer). L0 handles the initial onboarding experience.

Layer
Name
Purpose
Key Components
L0
Onboarding
Signup, context questions, tool connect, first data hydration
4 stages: Entry + AI Insights → AI Loader Demo → Context Selection → Tool Connect + First Hydration
L1
Context-Aware Workspace
15 modules rendering context-specific views of normalized data
Home, Projects, Accounts, Contacts, Meetings, Docs, Tasks, Calendar, Notes, Knowledge Space, Team, Pipeline, Risks, Expansion, Analytics
L2
Universal Cognitive Layer
14 cognitive components for reasoning, action, and governance
SpineUI, ContextUI, KnowledgeUI, Evidence, Signals, Think, Act, HITL, Govern, Adjust, Repeat, AuditUI, AgentConfig, DigitalTwin
L3
Universal Backend
The engine: 8-stage mandatory pipeline, 4 accelerators, 6 data stores
Pipeline stages, accelerators, stores, engines, dual-loop architecture, security model

Every piece of data — whether ingested from connected tools, uploaded as documents, or captured from AI chat sessions — must flow through L3 before reaching the workspace (L1) or cognitive layer (L2). There are no shortcuts.

3. L0: Onboarding Flow
L0 is the entry flow for new tenants. It is not a separate service — it is an orchestrated sequence across the Gateway, Connector, Pipeline, and Onboarding Accelerator. The design principle is to deliver value before asking for commitment.

Stage
What Happens
Duration
1. Entry + AI Insights
Name + DOB input. AI personality analysis generates working style predictions, strengths, and growth areas. First “wow moment” for the user.
0–15 sec
2. AI Loader Demo
Natural language input demo. AI transforms unstructured input into structured actions across 4 tools simultaneously. Second “wow moment.”
15–30 sec
3. Context Selection
Two workspace paths: Productivity Hub (OS) for ICs/PMs/Team Leads, or CS Platform for CSMs/AMs/CS Leaders. Same user can switch anytime — two lenses, not separate products. Signup (Google OAuth / email) happens here.
30–50 sec
4. Tool Connect + First Hydration
Connect 1–2 tools via OAuth or upload a data dump (CSV/JSON/PDF). Backfill sync runs paginated historical import through the full 8-stage pipeline. Onboarding Accelerator bootstraps the workspace.
50–120 sec

4. L1: Context-Aware Workspace (15 Modules)
The L1 workspace is the user-facing surface of IntegrateWise. It consists of 15 modules, each providing a context-aware projection of normalized data from the Spine. Modules are not independent apps — they are views into the same SSOT, rendered based on the active CTX enum (context type).

Module
Purpose
Key Data Sources

5. L2: Universal Cognitive Layer (14 Components)
The L2 cognitive layer is the reasoning and governance engine. Its 14 components are universal — they operate across all workspace contexts, not tied to any single module. Together, they form the intelligence that makes IntegrateWise a cognitive system rather than a passive data viewer.

6. L3: Universal Backend Engine
The L3 backend is the engine that powers the entire platform. It follows three inviolable principles:
	•	"Normalize Once, Render Anywhere" — every data object is transformed into a canonical schema exactly once and can then be projected into any context.
	•	"AI That Thinks in Context, Waits for Approvals" — all AI-driven actions require human-in-the-loop governance before execution.
	•	"Every Path is Mandatory" — no data bypasses the 8-stage pipeline regardless of source.
6.1 Three Data Ingestion Planes
All data entering IntegrateWise arrives via one of three planes. All three converge into the Think Engine, which produces Situations and Proposed Actions.
Plane
Data Type
Ingestion Path
Storage
Plane 1: Structured (Tool Data)
CRM deals, support tickets, billing events, calendar entries
Webhooks/Polling → Connector Service → 8-Stage Pipeline
Spine (Neon PostgreSQL)
Plane 2: Unstructured (Documents)
PDFs, CSVs, spreadsheets, emails, images
Upload/Watch → R2 raw storage → Knowledge Service → Chunk + Embed
Context Store (pgvector + R2)
Plane 3: AI Chats (MCP Sessions)
Conversations from Claude, ChatGPT, other AI providers
MCP Connectors → Session Summarization → Compress at Source
AI Chats Store
6.2 Eight-Stage Mandatory Pipeline
Every piece of data entering IntegrateWise — regardless of source, type, or urgency — must pass through all 8 stages. There are no shortcuts. This ensures data quality, consistency, security, and auditability. The pipeline is implemented as a series of Cloudflare Queue consumers, with each stage reading from an inbound queue, processing, and writing to the next stage’s queue. Failed items at any stage are routed to the DLQ (Dead Letter Queue).

Stage
Name
Processing
Failure Mode
1
Analyzer
Source detection, object type identification, metadata extraction, schema version check. Stamps payload with pipeline_id for traceability.
Unknown source or malformed payload → DLQ
2
Classifier
Category mapping to internal taxonomy, CTX enum assignment, priority scoring (critical/normal/batch), accelerator routing flags.
Unmappable object type → DLQ
3
Filter
Tenant-level and user-level data scope enforcement. Checks data against scope definitions set during L0 onboarding. PII detection flags.
Scope rule error → pass-through with warning
4
Refiner
Field-level transformations: date normalization (ISO 8601 UTC), currency conversion, text cleaning (HTML strip), entity resolution across tools.
Schema mapping failure → DLQ
5
Extractor
Relationship extraction (account→contacts, deal→line items), computed fields (deal velocity, sentiment), change delta calculation, embedding generation for documents.
Extraction failure → DLQ with partial results
6
Validator
Data integrity checks, deduplication (exact + fuzzy), business rule validation, cross-reference verification against existing Spine records.
Integrity violation → DLQ
7
Sanity Scan
AI-powered anomaly detection, outlier identification, test data detection. Uses rules + ML to quarantine suspicious data before it enters stores.
Anomaly detected → Quarantine for human review
8
Sectorizer
Final routing to appropriate stores (Spine, Context, AI Chats). Performs the dual-write. Emits events to Think Engine and triggers Accelerator recalculation.
Write failure → retry queue with backoff
6.3 Four Accelerator Systems
Accelerators are specialized computation engines that operate on data after it has been normalized and stored. They produce derived intelligence that feeds the L1 workspace and L2 cognitive layer.

Accelerator
Purpose
Key Components
Extraction Accelerator
Preserve tool-native structure during ingestion. Captures formulas, automations, and relationships that would be lost in normalization.
Ingress Controller, Tool Puller, Object Graph Builder, Formula Capture, Automation Capture, External ID Resolver
Normalization Accelerator
Map extracted data to the SSOT canonical schema. Handles schema detection, field transformation, and relationship preservation.
Schema Detector, Schema Registry, Category Mapper, Field Transformer, Relationship Preserver, SSOT Builder
Onboarding Accelerator
L0-specific compute. Analyzes initial data to bootstrap the workspace with presets, templates, and scope definitions.
Context Analyzer, Preset/Template Selector, Data Scope Definition
Domain Accelerators (×6)
Post-normalization domain-specific intelligence. Each produces scored, goal-linked metrics.
Customer Health Score, Churn Prediction, Revenue Forecaster, Pipeline Velocity, Support Health, Marketing Attribution
6.4 Six Data Stores
Store
Technology
Purpose
Access Pattern
Spine (SSOT)
Neon PostgreSQL
Canonical normalized records. The single source of truth for all structured data.
Read/write via Pipeline + Act Engine
Context Store
pgvector on Neon + R2
Embeddings, document chunks, and metadata for unstructured content. Enables semantic search.
Write via Pipeline; read via Knowledge components
AI Chats Store

Summarized AI chat sessions. Never stores full transcripts — only compressed summaries.
Write via MCP Connectors; read via KnowledgeUI
Audit Store
Neon (append-only)
Immutable log of every action, approval, data change, and system event.
Write-only from all services; read via AuditUI
Hot Memory
Cloudflare Durable Objects
Real-time state for active sessions, collaboration, and in-flight computations.
Read/write by Workers; auto-evicts to cold storage
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
Cloudflare Queue + Neon
Failed pipeline items with full context for debugging and replay.
Write from any pipeline stage; read by ops tooling

7. AI Agent System
only one cognitive twin 







































forecast adjustments

Approval-only execution: Every agent proposal passes through the HITL gate. The Think Engine generates situations and proposed actions; the Govern layer enforces policy compliance; the HITL component presents proposals to the human approver. Only after explicit approval does the Act Engine execute. The Adjust component captures the approval or rejection to improve future proposals.

8. Dual-Loop Architecture
IntegrateWise operates two reinforcing feedback loops that converge to create a self-improving system. This is the mechanism that closes the “data-back-to-learning” loop — the core differentiator.

8.1 Loop A: Context-to-Truth (Human-Governed)
Loop A captures human intelligence from governed channels (Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, Custom GPTs) and converts it into executable actions.
Context → Brainstorming → Action → Tool Write → Ingest → Normalize → Truth → View → Repeat

Critical Rule: Brainstorming NEVER becomes truth directly. Truth is only created when an action writes to a tool, and the ingestion pipeline confirms and normalizes it.
8.2 Loop B: Tool-to-Truth (System-Governed)
Loop B processes structured tool data through the continuous intelligence cycle.
Loader → 8-Stage Pipeline → Store (Spine) → Think Engine → Act Engine → Tool Write-Back → Repeat
8.3 Convergence
Loop A feeds Loop B through tools: human decisions result in tool updates, which Loop B ingests and normalizes. Loop A triggers change; Loop B confirms truth. Both converge into the Think Engine’s views, and both repeat continuously. The convergence point is the Spine, where all validated truth resides regardless of origin.

9. Infrastructure Stack

12. Growth-Aligned Data Model
IntegrateWise does not just track data — it tracks growth. Every record, metric, and signal is linked to organizational goals. This is the non-negotiable differentiator.

Dimension
Traditional Systems
IntegrateWise
Data Model
Static records: “We have 100 accounts with $850k ARR”
Active, goal-linked: “100 accounts at 85% of $1M goal, $150k gap, Acme at MEDIUM RISK”
View
Reactive — “What happened?”
Proactive, risk-aware — “What should I do to hit my goals?”
Action
Manual — human interprets and decides
Suggested, evidence-based — AI proposes, human approves
Learning
None — same static view regardless of outcomes
Continuous — every approval/rejection improves future proposals
Alignment
Data disconnected from goals
Every metric is a percentage of a goal, with risk scoring and gap analysis

13. Unique Architectural Combination
